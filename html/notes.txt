// need to make sure that everyone has the right permissions
// once someone has uploaded something make them an author??
// could maybe find the username in the stories names and if they have uploaded one they can edit and upload another
// if they have not uploaded one they can only comment




Issues right now


Need to build still
// main page with multiple stories -- logged in (no ad, search bar)
// main page with multiple stories -- reader (search bar, ad)
// story view page -- logged in (comments allowed, no ad present, can upload story, if have uploaded story can edit)
// story view page -- reader (no comment section allowed, ad present, cannot edit or upload story)
// edit page
// ad functionality
// test plan
// determine between reader (non logged in, commentor (logged in), author/editor (once you upload a story))
// make an if statement like if they have made a story edit a div for and edit story button to show up




Things to do next
// tests
// add good data
